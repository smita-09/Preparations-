You have three jars that are all mislabeled. One contains peanut butter jelly beans, another grape jelly jelly beans and the third has a mix of both (not necessarily half-half mix).

How many minimum jelly beans would you have to pull out to find out how to fix the labels on the jars?

Labels on jars are as follows

Jar 1 : Peanut butter
Jar 2 : Grape
Jar 3 : P.b. / Grape
Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.

Solution: So, there is a hidden clue behind the fact that all the jars are mislabeled and that actually helps us in a ways, so answe is actually 1 and let is go through it,
so to find the min number of picking, you must have to the pick the jar that is mislabeled as mixed one and you could easily figure out what jar is just by picking 1 candy from it so let's 
say that the jar is actually with peanut jelly and now you should go to the jar that is mislabeled as peanut jelly and how you do not need to pick any jelly because this jar can not be mixed 
one else jar with grape jelly would just wrong so it has to be the jar with grape jelly so you just picked one jelly to correctly label the jars. And now you just got yourself a 
correct answer!
