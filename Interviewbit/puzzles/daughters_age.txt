Two MIT math grads bump into each other at Fairway on the upper west side. They haven’t seen each other in over 20 years.

The first grad says to the second: “how have you been?”
Second: “great! i got married and i have three daughters now”
First: “really? how old are they?”
Second: “well, the product of their ages is 72, and the sum of their ages is the same as the number on that building over there..”
First: “right, ok.. oh wait.. hmm, i still don’t know”
Second: “oh sorry, the oldest one just started to play the piano”
First: “wonderful! my oldest is the same age!”
How old are the daughters?

Respond with daughter ages sorted in ascending order and concatenated together. No spaces.

Solution: So, there is a hidden clue behind telling that the sum is certain number and still not being able guess so there when you make all the factors of a number 72, 
and of the all the factors in 3 parts so as to calculate the sum, you will see that there is one number which is being repeated and that number is 3, 3, 8 and 2, 6, 6 and the 
next question when asked was answered with that there is something to do will the oldest daughter so ther is one oldest so the ages must be 3, 3 and 8. #
