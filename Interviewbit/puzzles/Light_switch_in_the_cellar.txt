In your cellar there are three light switches in the OFF position. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs on floor above. 

You may move any of the switches but you may only go upstairs to inspect the bulbs. 

When upstairs, you cannot access the switches. What is the minimum number of times you need to go upstairs to determine the switch for each bulb?

Since your answer is a integer, just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.

Solution: So, the important thing to note in here is that we need to find the switch associated to each bulbs, so just switch one light for a minute or so and then switch it off and then switch the other button and go upstairs and then the bulb which is lit is just associated to the switch you just pressed and the next is the bulb which is hot must be associated to the switch previously pressed and the bulb which is cold and not lit must be associated to the switch that we did not press.
