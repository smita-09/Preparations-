A couple invites n – 1 other couples to dinner. Once everyone arrives, each person shakes hands with everyone he doesn’t know.
 Then, the host asks everyone how many hands they shook and each person replies with a different number. Assuming that everyone knows his 
 or her own spouse, how many hands did the hostess shake?

Solution: I think the fact everyone gave different answers when asked how many handshakes they did has a hidden cluse behind it. So, I think when everyone said different 
handshakes then there should be numbers between 0 to 2N-1, 2N-2 because a person must know his wife or a person must know her husband so the eliminates of them.
Rest of the answer should be pretty clear and now keeping in mind the fact, let us take the eg. of 0th person so he would have shaken 0 hands cause lets say that hostess and host
already knew him and ofcourse he does not have to shake hand with his wife so there will be total of 0 handshakes and now his wife will handshake everyone except his husband and 
then the total number of handshakes for him would be 2N-2. 
and similarly lets say that person 2 does 1 handshake and that is the person who came before him so now his wife would shake the
